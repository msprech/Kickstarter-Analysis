Between 2009 and 2017, the highest number of successful theater kickstarter campaigns were launched in the month of May, with 111 successful and 52 failed outcomes. Theater campaigns as a whole are very popular within the US market, with 839 total successful campaigns to 493 failed campaigns. More specifically, play campaigns showed 412 successful kickstarter campaigns to 250 failed campaigns.

### Conservative Fundraising Goals 

Successful US Kickstarter campaigns within the play subcategory largely had lower fundraising goals than comparable failed campaigns. They also had considerably higher amounts pledged than the failed kickstarter campaigns. 


Several notable statistics within successful US kickstarter campaigns include the following: 
* Median Goal: $3,000
* IQR of Goal: $3,500 
* Median Pledged: $3,168
* IQR of Pledged: $3,982 


In contrast, the failed US kickstarter campaigns reported these findings: 
* Median Goal: $5,000
* IQR of Goal: $8,000
* Median Pledged: $103
* IQR of Pledged: $492

### Recommendations 

The most successful kickstarter campaigns all had significantly lower goals than the proposed $12,000. Louise should therefore consider lowering her budget in order to yield a higher fundraising pledge amount. 50% of successful fundraising goals fell between $1,500 and $5,000. 

Careful consideration of the launch date is also fundamental to a successful campaign. The most successful play campaigns were launched in the month of May, making this a promising candidate for launching a new campaign.
